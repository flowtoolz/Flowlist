Flowlist – Manage Life in Flow

The 1st Hierarchical Task List

# Flowlist AppStore Update Text

## 1.6.0

This update improves overall consistency and introduces TXT export. 

• You can export the focused list as a text via Cmd+E, manifesting your item hierarchy as paragraphs, headings, sub-headings etc.
• You can use editing commands within item texts: copy (Cmd+C), cut (Cmd+X), paste (Cmd+V) and select all (Cmd+A)
• You can undo infinite deletions in every list (Cmd+Z).
• Shift+Click works again to extend the current selection.
• You can use the ESC key to finish typing and also move back to the overview list.
• Fix: Visual delays related to selection changes are gone.
• Minor fixes, performance- and UI improvements
• Some significant technical improvements under the hood to maintain development speed


## 1.5.0

This update brings a total new design.  

• Flowlist looks much different, cleaner and more modern.
• It's easier to recognize which list is in focus, which items are selected, which are in progress, which are done, how lists are titled and how lists are tagged.
• Dark mode looks better and is more in line with Mojave (macOS 10.14) and Apple's guide lines.
• Flowlist adjusts when you switch between dark and light mode in the system settings of Mojave. You can still toggle dark mode independent of system settings. 
• Fix: Icons don't get cut off anymore.
• Fix: Font size changes are smoother and more accurate.
• Fix: Copy, cut and paste maintain the item order again.
• Fixes for issues that came up on macOS Mojave
• As always: Some technical improvements under the hood to maintain development speed

## 1.4.0

This update simplifies the visual design and introduces Dark Mode.

• Now you can switch between Dark Mode and Daylight Mode via menu option or Cmd+D.
• The user interface went back to its roots a bit and looks cleaner. Also, I toned down the high contrast selection.
• A bunch of little performance improvements
• The JSON format got much more compact and humanly readable in preparation for syncing with iOS (and for those who fiddle around with their flowlist.json file manually).
• As always: Several technical improvements under the hood to ensure development will never slow down

## 1.3.0

This update introduces colors!

• Now you can tag every item with a color by pressing a number or via menu option.
• Aside from color tags, the interface has finally reached a cool monochrome look, which I aimed for all along, and which prepares Flowlist for its dark mode (coming soon).
• You can now vote on which features I'll implement after the dark mode. The link is on the website and in the Help menu.
• As always: Some technical improvements under the hood to ensure development will never slow down

## 1.2.2

This update fixes a bug that occurred when navigating via mouse.

Apparently, some users did navigate exclusively via mouse. However, Flowlist is much more rapid, intuitive and fun when controlled via keyboard like a game! Flowlist is supposed to be controlled via keyboard, and only that way does it unfold its charme ;)

## 1.2.1

This update brings minor fixes and performance improvements:
• Fix: The welcome tour now properly appears on the very first launch.
• Fix: The panel for purchasing the full version now has a consistent font size, independent of screen size. Also its layout is more robust and adaptive.
• Fix: Item heights were occasionally incorrect, which is now fixed.
• Items load and layout quicker.
• Other minor adjustments
• As always: Some technical improvements under the hood to ensure development will never slow down

## 1.2.0

• You can now make the font bigger and smaller, via menu or key command. The whole layout will adjust to the font size you choose, including the size of icons.
• The navigation animation is now flawless and smooth. After the previous update (1.1.0) required new technology which made the animation slower and exposed its pre-existing flaws, I rebuilt huge parts of the app, implementing a much better approach.
• Further performance improvements
• Minor UI improvements
• As always: Many technical improvements under the hood to ensure development will never slow down

## 1.1.0

• Multi line items allow to write structured texts. Empty items now correspond as paragraphs and non-empty items to headings
• Web URLs and email adresses are now hyperlinked and clickable
• The UI is updated, hopefully improved, in particular related to legibility, item editing and list headers
• A "Help" menu now offers links to documentation, the welcome tour and a contact email for your feature requests, bug reports and questions
• The "Select" menu now shows all applicable selection options and their key commands
• A welcome tour now explains the app to new users and whenever the app is launched with no existing items
• Editing (renaming) an item does not select its whole text anymore
• Lists follow moves of undone items through animated scrolling
• Up and down arrow keys now select the top and bottom item when the focused list has no selection
• Bug fix: When pasting content from web pages or documents, item detection does not trim special characters from the end of texts anymore
• As always: Many technical improvements under the hood to ensure development will never slow down

# Flowlist 1.0 Tutorial

* In the next 3 minutes, we'll have a look at Flowlist and see what the app can already do. Unfortunately, I didnt have the time to make a shorter video.
* After first launch it looks quite deserted. We have a list header here displaying the app's filename. This list contains items stored inside the app, but right now, the app is empty.
* In Flowlist, you can do everything with the keyboard. (show menu options) So your hands never have to switch to a trackpad or mouse in between writing.
* In this video, you'll see every key command I hit visualized in the bottom right corner.
* Now, Let's create some items:
    * ice with Susan
    * bring package to post office
    * groceries
    * suffer through dentist's appointment
    * write article
    * organize workshop
* I feel a bit distracted by those other windows, we could switch to monotasking mode like that (switch), but let's go fullscreen and really focus. (...)
* For these 4 tasks (select 1-4), I gotta head to the city, so let's group them (group -> name city)
* Those tasks (point) are now subtasks of city
* Now let's focus the new "city" list (enter it). You see there's always context to the left, the item or list of interest in the middle, and details to the right. And we move in and out to change our focus.
* I got my priorities wrong here, the dreaded appointment is in the morning, the reward comes last (moving 4 to 1 then 2 to 4)
* Oh, I need my bike to do all that, and I think I forgot it in the city yesterday night after some drinks. So I should find that first. (space -> find bike)
* The space bar adds an item to the top of the list, almost like pushing an item onto a stack. (quickly add some untitled items)
* Now, let's get back to this. (select organize workshop) I'm not sure what it takes to organize a workshop, so let's focus its details and brainstorm (enter the task)
    * book location
    * prepare content
    * invite people
* the location should be booked for either tuesday or thursday (add subtask "tuesday or thursday") and i gotta talk to tim about it (add another subtask "tim knows more..."
* items don't have descriptions to detail them, because we can always add sub items for that, like we did here. (move out, point to sub items)
* this article is actually part of the workshop content, so I cut it out and insert it where it belongs (cut and paste "write article")
* the article will certainly have sections (create item "section")
* let's create a bunch of them (copy and paste "section" 4 times)
* and you know what, I can name them better (rename first 5, appending these titles)
    * 1. intro
    * 2. challenge
    * 3. solution
    * 4. in practice
    * 5. outlook
* The others we don't need (delete multiple including "outlook")
* Oops, I deleted 1 too many, but I can undo that. (undo)
* Notice, we write and delete items like lines in a text (delete single single items, add some with enter, delete again)
* now we go to wikipedia (swipe screen) copy some text (copy formatted bullet points or so)
* and paste the text as items into section 1 of our article (...)
* Btw. let's say we completed our little city tour ... so check those tasks off (check 1st 3 off)
* the tasks that are done are now at the bottom of the list, with the last checked item first, like we piled them onto a stack
* That's all the time I got. Thanks for watching.
