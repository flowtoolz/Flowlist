I really like the simplicity of it - I have to admit I first downloaded without reading and it took me a few seconds to lear the keys - once you get into it its great - but you should have a first time user walk through of the keys\

is the UX of mouse only fully covered or is not in your plan? i.e. how can I start an sub item using my mouse\
WOW - a thing I just discovered (edited)\

simple but soo cool! love it\
better than full screen as the grey is almost too much when it is full screen\
obv it doesn't work with "longer text tasks" - I presume that is intentional but there are some use cases where that could break\
i.e. is there a space in your data model/ux for a description of the task - top level at least? or would that break the simplicity you are trying to get?\
I think actually the keyboard only should be a good marketing point / strength of the app - it keeps you in the flow\
I think it is a great brainstorming tool as it helps you structure your thoughts\
but if you want to make your task list / JIRA style or trello or etc.. chances are you need more advanced feature (you can argue you don't but it is worth thinking what features would you need to add to make me move away from jira/trello)\
I didn't fully get the start item until now\
but now I get it and it is really a cool way to think about it\
\
how do I move items up or down within a list or across the lists ?\
the only order I can set is whether to add top or bottom\
there seems to be no relationship between child items with parent items? if I finish all items in the child -  the parent is not affected}
