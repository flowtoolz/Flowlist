#Flowlist AppStore Description

Flowlist is an elegant app for capturing ideas and managing tasks. Its editable item hierarchy makes it simple yet powerful. Be in a flow state while organizing your thoughts and your life!

Flowlist is radically simple yet super flexible. If you're into that, you can use Flowlist to:

* Quickly capture whatever pops into your head
* Develop notes into ideas
* Manage tasks and projects
* Plan your day and your future

Flowlist helps you to be in a flow state:

* Evolve your own item hierarchy: Group items together, add subitems to any item, move items to a whole different level. Flowlist does not force your items into categories like project, task, subtask or description.
* You chose the scope of your focus by navigating your item hierarchy. No matter on what level you are, there's always an overview to the left and details of a selected item to the right.
* Your hands never have to leave the keyboard for anything. You can do everything via a few intuitive key commands
* The interface is super clean. No buttons, knobs, alerts, popups and such clutter.
* Use Flowlist in fullscreen or in monotasking mode to really focus.

#Flowlist 1.0 Tutorial

* In the next 3 minutes, we'll have a look at Flowlist and see what the app can already do. Unfortunately, I didnt have the time to make a shorter video.
* After first launch it looks quite deserted. We have a list header here displaying the app's filename. This list contains items stored inside the app, but right now, the app is empty.
* In Flowlist, you can do everything with the keyboard. (show menu options) So your hands never have to switch to a trackpad or mouse in between writing.
* In this video, you'll see every key command I hit visualized in the bottom right corner.
* Now, Let's create some items:
    * ice with Susan
    * bring package to post office
    * groceries
    * suffer through dentist's appointment
    * write article
    * organize workshop
* I feel a bit distracted by those other windows, we could switch to monotasking mode like that (switch), but let's go fullscreen and really focus. (...)
* For these 4 tasks (select 1-4), I gotta head to the city, so let's group them (group -> name city)
* Those tasks (point) are now subtasks of city
* Now let's focus the new "city" list (enter it). You see there's always context to the left, the item or list of interest in the middle, and details to the right. And we move in and out to change our focus.
* I got my priorities wrong here, the dreaded appointment is in the morning, the reward comes last (moving 4 to 1 then 2 to 4)
* Oh, I need my bike to do all that, and I think I forgot it in the city yesterday night after some drinks. So I should find that first. (space -> find bike)
* The space bar adds an item to the top of the list, almost like pushing an item onto a stack. (quickly add some untitled items)
* Now, let's get back to this. (select organize workshop) I'm not sure what it takes to organize a workshop, so let's focus its details and brainstorm (enter the task)
    * book location
    * prepare content
    * invite people
* the location should be booked for either tuesday or thursday (add subtask "tuesday or thursday") and i gotta talk to tim about it (add another subtask "tim knows more..."
* items don't have descriptions to detail them, because we can always add sub items for that, like we did here. (move out, point to sub items)
* this article is actually part of the workshop content, so I cut it out and insert it where it belongs (cut and paste "write article")
* the article will certainly have sections (create item "section")
* let's create a bunch of them (copy and paste "section" 4 times)
* and you know what, I can name them better (rename first 5, appending these titles)
    * 1. intro
    * 2. challenge
    * 3. solution
    * 4. in practice
    * 5. outlook
* The others we don't need (delete multiple including "outlook")
* Oops, I deleted 1 too many, but I can undo that. (undo)
* Notice, we write and delete items like lines in a text (delete single single items, add some with enter, delete again)
* now we go to wikipedia (swipe screen) copy some text (copy formatted bullet points or so)
* and paste the text as items into section 1 of our article (...)
* Btw. let's say we completed our little city tour ... so check those tasks off (check 1st 3 off)
* the tasks that are done are now at the bottom of the list, with the last checked item first, like we piled them onto a stack
* That's all the time I got. Thanks for watching.
