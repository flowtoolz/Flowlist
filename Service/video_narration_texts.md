#Flowlist Promo Video / Teaser

* Ever feel overwhelmed by all the things you want to accomplish? your errands? your projects? ideas and big dreams?

* With Flowlist, I
    * Quickly capture whatever pops into my head
    * I develop notes into Ideas,
    * Manage Tasks and Projects
    * and Plan my Day and my Future
* Now, Flowlist can do all these things, not because it's packed with menus, knobs and buttons, but because it is so radically simple.
    * Write and delete items just like lines in a text
    * prioritize

#Flowlist 1.0 Tutorial

* In the next 3 minutes, we'll have a look at Flowlist and see what the app can already do. Unfortunately, I didnt have the time to make a shorter video.
* After first launch it looks quite deserted. We have a list header here displaying the app's filename. This list contains items stored inside the app, but right now, the app is empty.
* In Flowlist, you can do everything with the keyboard. (show menu options) So your hands never have to switch to a trackpad or mouse in between writing.
* In this video, you'll see every key command I hit visualized in the bottom right corner.
* Now, Let's create some items:
    * ice with Susan
    * bring package to post office
    * groceries
    * suffer through dentist's appointment
    * write article
    * organize workshop
* I feel a bit distracted by those other windows, we could switch to monotasking mode like that (switch), but let's go fullscreen and really focus. (...)
* For these 4 tasks (select 1-4), I gotta head to the city, so let's group them (group -> name city)
* Those tasks (point) are now subtasks of city
* Now let's focus the new "city" list (enter it). You see there's always context to the left, the item or list of interest in the middle, and details to the right. And we move in and out to change our focus.
* I got my priorities wrong here, the dreaded appointment is in the morning, the reward comes last (moving 4 to 1 then 2 to 4)
* Oh, I need my bike to do all that, and I think I forgot it in the city yesterday night after some drinks. So I should find that first. (space -> find bike)
* The space bar adds an item to the top of the list, almost like pushing an item onto a stack. (quickly add some untitled items)
* Now, let's get back to this. (select organize workshop) I'm not sure what it takes to organize a workshop, so let's focus its details and brainstorm (enter the task)
    * book location
    * prepare content
    * invite people
* the location should be booked for either tuesday or thursday (add subtask "tuesday or thursday") and i gotta talk to tim about it (add another subtask "tim knows more..."
* items don't have descriptions to detail them, because we can always add sub items for that, like we did here. (move out, point to sub items)
* this article is actually part of the workshop content, so I cut it out and insert it where it belongs (cut and paste "write article")
* the article will certainly have sections (create item "section")
* let's create a bunch of them (copy and paste "section" 4 times)
* and you know what, I can name them better (rename first 5, appending these titles)
    * 1. intro
    * 2. challenge
    * 3. solution
    * 4. in practice
    * 5. outlook
* The others we don't need (delete multiple including "outlook")
* Oops, I deleted 1 too many, but I can undo that. (undo)
* Notice, we write and delete items like lines in a text (delete single single items, add some with enter, delete again)
* now we go to wikipedia (swipe screen) copy some text (copy formatted bullet points or so)
* and paste the text as items into section 1 of our article (...)
* Btw. let's say we completed our little city tour ... so check those tasks off (check 1st 3 off)
* the tasks that are done are now at the bottom of the list, with the last checked item first, like we piled them onto a stack
* That's all the time I got. Thanks for watching.

#Flowlist Backstory

Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do, and even more by all the stuff I'm passionate about. So, most of my life, I've been on a quest to sort myself out, get more shit done and turn more ideas into real things.

What played a central role in that quest where the task managers I used to organize my TODOs **and thoughts**. I tried them all, some for a long time: Todoist, Wunderlist, Omnifocus, Flow, Anydo, Things, Trello and even Apple's Reminders app.

You guessed it - I found them all frustrating. One particular aspect they share doesn't jive at all with the way I think: They force your notes into fixed categories like *Project*, *Task*, *Subtask* and *Description*. 

However reality isn't fragmented by such arbitrary categories, much less can you know the category or abstraction level of a thought the moment it pops into your head. The structure of ideas, tasks or "projects" rather emerges from the process of thinking about- or working on them.

Because they are so rigid, conventional task managers are really bad at capturing thoughts, brainstorming, developing ideas through "live thinking" or iterating over tasks and projects over time.

I need to evolve my captured items to keep them in line with reality. I need a tool that supports an agile (i.e. realistic) way of thinking, working and living. That means, it must allow to freely mould the item hierarchy: Group items together, add sub items "into" an item, move items to a whole different level, and so forth.

So a year ago, I prototyped a novel kind of task manager and named it "Flowlist". And I've been happily using it every day since. This year, I decided to turn Flowlist into much more and make it available to you. More is to come at [flowlistapp.com](http://flowlistapp.com).

Go to flowlistapp.com and start organizing your thoughts and your life today!

#Flowlist Future Development

Put on shades, the future is bright. Version 1.0 isn't even the beginning. I have many great things planned for Flowlist. 

* A system wide keyboard short cut will allow you to quickly capture thoughts, even while you're using other apps. Neither will you forget anything nor will you be distracted. Whenever you have an idea, you capture it and just move on with whatever you're doing.

* Each item will have a long form description text. This seemingly minor addition will turn Flowlist into a creative writing tool. Organizing thoughts will, at the same time, structure and grow a potential text. You'll be able to export any item as plain text, LaTeX, markdown or HTML, with autogenerated headers, subheaders and so forth.

* Flowlist will have independent filters that let you customize what items you see. There'll be a custom tag hierarchy, colors, a live keyword search, due dates and more task states like "in progress" or "trashed". For example you'll be able to setup a filter that shows all work-related appointments and tasks of today.

#Flowlist Pricing

I really don't like paid subscriptions. So I'll never require this for Flowlist. You pay once, then you can use the app forever.

Flowlist costs much less than conventional task managers and it always will besause, honestly, the competition's pricing is ridiculous. One reason why they are so expensive is that the concept (domain model) they started with is not as thought trough, elegant and universal as that of Flowlist. So the same amount of invested resources adds much less capabilities to their apps.

Now, as I'll make Flowlist more and more powerful, I'll have to adjust the price a bit. But I also reward your trust: When you have the app, you'll get all new features as free updates. For early birds, Flowlist is a steal.
