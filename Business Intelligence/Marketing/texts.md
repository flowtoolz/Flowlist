#Flowlist AppStore Description

## Version 1.0.9

Flowlist is an elegant self-management tool optimized for total creative focus. Hierarchical lists make it as simple and adaptable as a box of legos. Organize your thoughts and your life in a state of flow!

Watch a 30 second video at www.flowlistapp.com

Flowlist does not force your stuff into categories like "Project" or "Todo". Instead, items are universal and may contain other items, like folders on your Mac contain other folders. You're free to organize yourself in your own way.

A novel interaction concept combines intuitive key commands, a clean interface and meaningful animations, so you can rapidly navigate and edit your item hierarchy in a state of deep concentration.

You may use Flowlist to:

• Capture whatever pops into your head
• Support your thought process
• Grow a backlog of ideas
• Establish good habits
• Manage tasks and projects
• Keep track of responsibilities
• Plan your day and your future

Flowlist helps you to get into flow:

• You evolve your own item hierarchy: group items together, add subitems to any (empty) item, move items to a whole different level.
• Your hands never have to leave the keyboard and your eyes can stay focused on your content. With just a few intelligently laid out key commands, you have rapid control over everything.
• The interface is focused. You change focus by navigating your item hierarchy. Overview is always to the left and details are always to the right. 
• The interface is clean. No buttons, knobs, alerts, popups and such clutter.
• Flowlist animates all your navigation and editing, which makes it fun to use and helps keeping track of changes.
• Flowlist is made for fullscreen and also offers a monotasking mode that blends out all other apps, the dock and the menu bar.

This free version has all features, saves all items and will never expire. It is only limited to 100 items, not counting groups, which will be enough in many contexts. Try it for yourself, a progress bar at the bottom tracks your item count.

You can support the development of Flowlist by unlocking the full unlimited version from within the app:
• Pay once, then use Flowlist forever. No subscription required.
• Early bird advantage: Owners of the full version get all new features as free updates, even when the full version price rises.

#Flowlist 1.0 Tutorial

* In the next 3 minutes, we'll have a look at Flowlist and see what the app can already do. Unfortunately, I didnt have the time to make a shorter video.
* After first launch it looks quite deserted. We have a list header here displaying the app's filename. This list contains items stored inside the app, but right now, the app is empty.
* In Flowlist, you can do everything with the keyboard. (show menu options) So your hands never have to switch to a trackpad or mouse in between writing.
* In this video, you'll see every key command I hit visualized in the bottom right corner.
* Now, Let's create some items:
    * ice with Susan
    * bring package to post office
    * groceries
    * suffer through dentist's appointment
    * write article
    * organize workshop
* I feel a bit distracted by those other windows, we could switch to monotasking mode like that (switch), but let's go fullscreen and really focus. (...)
* For these 4 tasks (select 1-4), I gotta head to the city, so let's group them (group -> name city)
* Those tasks (point) are now subtasks of city
* Now let's focus the new "city" list (enter it). You see there's always context to the left, the item or list of interest in the middle, and details to the right. And we move in and out to change our focus.
* I got my priorities wrong here, the dreaded appointment is in the morning, the reward comes last (moving 4 to 1 then 2 to 4)
* Oh, I need my bike to do all that, and I think I forgot it in the city yesterday night after some drinks. So I should find that first. (space -> find bike)
* The space bar adds an item to the top of the list, almost like pushing an item onto a stack. (quickly add some untitled items)
* Now, let's get back to this. (select organize workshop) I'm not sure what it takes to organize a workshop, so let's focus its details and brainstorm (enter the task)
    * book location
    * prepare content
    * invite people
* the location should be booked for either tuesday or thursday (add subtask "tuesday or thursday") and i gotta talk to tim about it (add another subtask "tim knows more..."
* items don't have descriptions to detail them, because we can always add sub items for that, like we did here. (move out, point to sub items)
* this article is actually part of the workshop content, so I cut it out and insert it where it belongs (cut and paste "write article")
* the article will certainly have sections (create item "section")
* let's create a bunch of them (copy and paste "section" 4 times)
* and you know what, I can name them better (rename first 5, appending these titles)
    * 1. intro
    * 2. challenge
    * 3. solution
    * 4. in practice
    * 5. outlook
* The others we don't need (delete multiple including "outlook")
* Oops, I deleted 1 too many, but I can undo that. (undo)
* Notice, we write and delete items like lines in a text (delete single single items, add some with enter, delete again)
* now we go to wikipedia (swipe screen) copy some text (copy formatted bullet points or so)
* and paste the text as items into section 1 of our article (...)
* Btw. let's say we completed our little city tour ... so check those tasks off (check 1st 3 off)
* the tasks that are done are now at the bottom of the list, with the last checked item first, like we piled them onto a stack
* That's all the time I got. Thanks for watching.
